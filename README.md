## Cam Paint:
A webcam-based painting program that uses a flood-fill algorithm to identify and color-in distinct regions on the webcam based on a "click" from the user. Once a region has been selected, it can then be used as a "paintbrush" to fill in other areas on the screen.

## Collision Detector
Allows user to insert moving dots on the screen by clicking, and then detects when any two dots collide using a quad-tree-based approach. 

## Huffman
Implements Huffman encoding to compress and decompress text files.

## Bacon Game
Bacon game builds a graph in which actors are represented by vertices and edges are created between two actors if they have been co-stars in a movie. A user can make a query for an actor and Bacon Game will use a breadth first search to find the "path" from that actor to Kevin Bacon, or between any two actors of the user's choice, outputting the details of the path (actor name and movie connection) to the user. The user interface also enables the user to find the number of actors with a path to the current "center" of the graph (as selected by the user) and find the average path length over all of the actors who are in some way connected to the current "center".

## POS Tagger
Part of speech tagger uses the Brown Corpus to build a hidden Markov model for the words in the corpus and their parts of speech. A Viterbi algorithm is then used to find the most likely sequence of parts-of-speech for a sentence provided by the user based on the probabilities for each next state in the hidden Markov model.
